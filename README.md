# Optimizing Search for The Shortest Route in A Weighted Directed Graph under Constraint

This is a project I completed while taking "MITx: 6.00.2x Intro to Computational Thinking and Data Science" on Edx. The purpose of this project is to allow students to write an optimization method to find the shortest overall path in a weighted directed graph from start node to end node under constraint. The method is then applied to find the shortest route from one building to another on the MIT campus given with a constrain on the amount of time one spends walking outdoors

The python codes I wrote are in ps5.py, and an overview of this project is provided in Background of Optimization.pdf .
