# Optimizing Search for The Shortest Route in A Weighted Digraph under Constraint

In this course project I wrote an optimization method to find the shortest overall path in a weighted directed graph. I then applied the method to find the shortest route from one building to another on a college campus while minimizing the amount of time one would have to spend walking outdoors.

The python codes I wrote are in ps5.py, and an overview of this project is provided in Background of Optimization.pdf .
